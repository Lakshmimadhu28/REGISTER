This project is a simple authentication system built using Node.js, HTML, and JSON for user data storage. It includes:

Registration page: Allows users to register using a name, email or phone number, and password. The data is validated and stored in a JSON file.
Login page: Enables users to log in with their credentials. The input is validated, and if the credentials match the data in the JSON file, a success alert is shown.
The project doesn't rely on any database and instead uses a simple JSON file (users.json) to store user information.
